### Hey! I'm [@Shayush04](https://twitter.com/Shayush04) (Shay R.) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer and full stack developer from Israel. ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡±

- I do C++, C, Lua, Java, C#, ASM, SQL some VB, Javascript, PHP, HTML, CSS and more.
- I've privated most of my big projects and left a few ones due to privacy and kids that copy off my work and miscredit me. If you're still interested on my previous projects contact me.
